Hi all, This program implements the usage of mutex as in previous thread program we have seen that the data was corrupted due to lack of synchronization.Hence we used Mutex to avoid the data corruption.

To execute the program:
1) Create mutex executable (make mutex)
2) Execte the executable (./mutex)
