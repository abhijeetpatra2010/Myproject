Hi all, Here is your socket implementation where i have used UDP protocol for communication between the server and the client.Server would be in receiving mode and any client can connect to the server.To execute the program :

1) Generate server executable( make server)
2) Generate client executable(make client)
3) Execute server in one terminal (./server)
4) Execute client in another terminal (./client)
